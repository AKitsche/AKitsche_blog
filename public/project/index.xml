      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this study power and sample size calculations for the analysis of treatment-by-subgroup interactions are proposed. Therefore, the interaction effect is either defined via product-type interaction  contrasts or as ratio of treatment differences. The latter formulation allows besides the detection of interactions also the assessment of the consistency/heterogeneity of the subgroup-specific treatment effect by the definition of an inconsistency margin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find the pdf of a detailed article &lt;a href=&#34;/files/pdf/PowerConsistency_SIM.pdf&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Furthermore, the slides from a corresponding talk are given &lt;a href=&#34;/files/JournalClub_Power.pdf&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Alternative effect size measurements corresponding to the two sample t-test</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If interest is in comparing the means of two (normally distributed) samples it is common practise to perform a two-sample t-test and report the corresponding p-value. Nevertheless, it has been widely criticized that the p-value does not provide a measure for the magnitude of the mean effect (e.g., Browne (2010)). This report provides an overview of existing alternatives recently published in the scientific literature that provide a more meaningful measurement of the effect size. Browne (2010) introduced closed form equations to translate a significant t-test p-value and sample size into the probability of one treatment being more successful than another on a per individual basis. This term was afterwards denoted as win probability by Hayter (2013) and he demonstrated the interpretation as &amp;ldquo;what would happen if a single future observation were to be taken from either of the two treatments, with attention being directed towards which treatment would win by providing the better value.&amp;rdquo; In addition Hayter (2013) introduced the corresponding confidence interval as well as the odds of X being greater than Y. He further introduced the transformation into Cohens effect size and the corresponding confidence intervals.&lt;/p&gt;
